## Rive Runtime

This module uses the `@rive-app/webgl` runtime for high performance. It handles the loading and rendering of your `.riv` files.

## State Machines

Rive's power lies in State Machines. Instead of just playing a timeline, you interact with a State Machine that transitions between animations based on inputs (Triggers, Booleans, Numbers).

## Artboards

A text file can contain multiple Artboards. You can specify which Artboard to display using the `artboard` property in `rive-params`.

## Text Runs

Text Runs allow you to replace text within an animation dynamically. This is handled reactively via the `text-runs` prop on the `<Rive>` component.
